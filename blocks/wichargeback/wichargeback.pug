              |Chargebacks are a forced transaction reversal 
              |initiated by the cardholder’s bank. Is simple
              |terms, it’s the reversal of a credit card payment 
              |that comes directly from the bank. If you’re 
              |a consumer, chargebacks represent a shield 
              |between you and dishonest merchants.

              |On the outside, chargebacks can appear 
              |very similar to traditional refunds, 
              |yet there is one very relevant difference: 
              |rather than contact the business for a refund,
              |the consumer is asking the bank to forcibly
              |take money from the business’s account. 
              |An investigation follows, and if the bank 
              |feels the cardholder’s request is valid, 
              |funds are removed from the merchant’s 
              |account and returned to the consumer
